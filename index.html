            <h2>Hello World!</h2>
            <p>I am currently a graduate student at <a href="https://www.cecs.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering and Computer Science, University of Central Florida</a> [Expected graduation: May, 2021].</br>
    &emsp; &emsp;My current research interest lies at the intesection of <rb>computational social science</rb>, <rb>complex adaptive systems</rb>, <rb>network sciences</rb> and <rb>big data</rb>. Primarily, I try to engineer features from big data and use them to model the behavior of networks and societies.</br>
    &emsp; &emsp;Formerly, I worked with <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in" target="_blank">Indian Space Research Organisation</a> where I was involved in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSAT" target="_blank">GSAT(s)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_National_Satellite_System" target="_blank">INSAT(s)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpana-1" target="_blank">METSAT</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Regional_Navigation_Satellite_System" target="_blank">IRNSS(s)</a> projects. My previous research areas included deep space networks, IoT and parallel computing. I graduated from <a href="https://www.iist.ac.in" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology</a> in 2013 with BTech in Avionics, majoring in Computer Science. Feel free to check out my work or get in touch with me.</p>

            <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
            <a href="https://github.com/anrikus/Complex-Adaptive-System-Forest-Fire-Model-Extension" target="_blank">Cellular automata based model for forest fire detection </a>
            <p>Extended the Forest Fire Extension 1 model from Netlogo 6.0 library to incorporate, random spontaneous fire start. To study fire fighting effectiveness, cretaed two separate models, first based on traditional watch towers to provide a baseline for performance and the second based to wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks proved to be a very cost-effective and efficient solution compared to the traditional watch towers.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/anrikus/ComplexAdaptiveSystemCivilViolenceModelExtension">Effect of state sponsored and independent media on public perception of grievance</a>
            <p>Extended Joshua M. Epstein's model presented in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/99/suppl_3/7243"> this paper</a> to incorporate the effect of compromised media and alternative methods of propaganda spread and its effect on public perception of the legitimacy of the government.</p>
            <a href="https://github.com/anrikus/LockFreeHashMap">Concurrent lock free and obstruction-free hash map</a>
            <p>Lock free and obstruction free hash map implementations based on <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3209690">Lock-Free Transactional Transformation for Linked Data Structures</a></p>
            <a href="https://github.com/anrikus/MRLocksHashMap" target="_blank">Concurrent hash map using MRLocks</a>
            <p><a href="http://cse.eecs.ucf.edu/gitlab/deli/mrlock" target="_blank">MRLocks</a> provides a fine grainded queue based locking mechanism for traditional non-concurrent data structure effectively making them thread safe and offers greatly improved performance over traditional coarse grained locking.</p>
